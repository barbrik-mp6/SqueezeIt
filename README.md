## Core Features

*   **100% Privacy First:** All processing is done client-side. Images are never uploaded, ensuring your data remains completely private.
*   **Dual Compression Modes:**
    *   **File Size Priority:** A smart algorithm that aggressively works to meet a target file size while preserving the maximum possible quality.
    *   **Quality Priority:** A mode that preserves the original image dimensions and compresses based on a simple 1-100 quality scale.
*   **Modern Format Conversion:** Convert any standard image format into WebP (recommended), JPEG, or PNG.
*   **Advanced Background Tools:** Remove an image background or fill it with any color you choose using a color picker.
*   **Installable PWA:** The application can be installed on your desktop or mobile home screen for a native, offline-first experience.
*   **Premium & Minimalist Design:** Meticulously designed with a cohesive color palette, harmonious spacing, and a focus on a clean, professional user experience.

## The Philosophy

This project was built with the design philosophy of a premium, minimalist toolâ€”something that a professional would be happy to use. The goal was to create an interface that is intuitive, elegant, and respects the user's privacy and data above all else. Every element is deliberate, from the spacing and color palette to the professional filename generation for downloaded images.
